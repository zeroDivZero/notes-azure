# SCALABILITY

To adjust resources to meet demand. When experiencing sudden traffic surge, dynamically adds more resources. Not overpaying for resources not used.

## Vertical Scaling

Increasing/decreasing capabilities of resources. When app needs more processing power, can vertically scale up to add more CPUs or RAM to VM. Vice versa.

## Horizontal Scaling

Adding/subtracting number of resources. Depending on traffic, scale out (adding more VMs or containers) or scale in.

## Elasticity

Ease of scaling in both directions, usually refers to automatic scaling. **Azure-Scale** is Azure's auto-scaling service.

Azure handles heavy-lifting of scaling, usually accomplished in seconds. Speed and flexibility often called cloud *agility*.
