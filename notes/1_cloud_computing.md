# CLOUD COMPUTING

Delivery of computing services over internet, including common IT infrastructure like virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Also expands to include IoT, ML, and AI.

Not constrained by physical infrastructure like traditional datacenter, allows rapid scaling.

Since computers in cloud, only pay for services used and share resources with other consumers. Basic services: **compute power** and **storage**.

## Compute Power

How much processing can be done. Not limited by own hardware (CPU, RAM, etc.), scale and pay as needed.

## Storage

Volume of data can be stored.
