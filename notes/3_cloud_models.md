# CLOUD MODELS

Defines deployment type of cloud resources. 3 main models: private, public, and hybrid.

## Private

Evolution of data center, cloud (IT services over Internet) used by single entity. Greater control at greater cost. Can be hosted at onsite or offsite data center.

## Public

Built, controlled, and maintained by 3rd-party cloud provider. Anyone who wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. Public availability is key difference between public and private clouds.

## Hybrid

Uses both private and public clouds. Allows private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. Can provide extra security (which services to keep in public vs. private).

## Multi-cloud

Uses multiple public cloud providers. Maybe using different features from different providers. Maybe started cloud journey with one provider and migrating to another.
