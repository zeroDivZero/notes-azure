# CONSUMPTION-BASED MODEL

To use only computing resources required at particular time.

Two expense types pertaining to IT infrastructure models: **capital expenditure (CapEx)** and **operational expenditure (OpEx)**.

## CapEx

One-time, up-front expenditure on tangible resources, such as building datacenter.

## OpEx

Spending on services or products over time.

## Cloud Computing

Falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on **consumption-based model**. Not paying for physical infrastructure, electricity, security, or other datacenter maintenance. Paying for IT resources used.

Benefits:

* No upfront costs.
* No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that might not be used to full potential.
* Ability to pay for more resources when needed.
* Ability to stop paying for resources no longer needed.

With datacenter, often need to estimate future expenses, ending up overpaying or underpaying. Cloud computing is like renting someone else's datacenter on-demand.
